description: "Personal website of Daniel Strunk, a web developer."

I'm Daniel Strunk, a web developer from Columbus, GA, USA. I enjoy working with
and expanding my knowledge of web development through [Ruby][ruby] and
[Elixir][elixir] (JavaScript can come too--at the moment I'm interested in [Elm][elm]).

I love working with Vim and Tmux, and [my dotfiles][dotfiles] are a testament to
that workflow. I'm a bit of a process nerd in that respect.

I've got a couple of projects I'm hacking on posted to [my Github][github]. Most
of the projects are [breakable toys][apprenticeship-patterns] meant to prove a concept, 
but my ultimate goal is to release a couple as SaaS products one day.

[I blog about web development][til] semi-regularly. Got a topic you'd like to
see covered? [Post an issue.][til-issues]

[Also, follow me on Twitter!][twitter] Or, if you have a burning question or 
comment that takes up more than 140 characters, you can send me an email at 
[hello@danielstrunk.me].
