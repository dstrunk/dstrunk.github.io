<p>
    As a self-taught developer, my primary means of learning has always been through breakable toys&mdash;that is, empty canvases that welcome failure, where the only true goal is learning itself.
</p>

<p>
Some projects, like <strong>SubjectMatter</strong>, are an attempt to grok machine learning concepts through the only language I knew at the time, Ruby (I've since learned that a language with stronger ML support, like Python, would be better suited to the task). Others, like <strong>Loupe</strong>, are purely academic pursuits to push WordPress to its limits. <strong>Tombstone</strong> is probably the most practical (and complete) of the bunch, being a Ruby on Rails-backed simple state machine to manage projects for my team at Communicorp&mdash;complete with months-long running job queues using Redis, email notifications with Mandrill, and admin functionality.
