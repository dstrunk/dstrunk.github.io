I promise a full post is coming soon! In the meantime, here is a great primer on setting up [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "Grunt JS") to simplify your workflow. You can use Grunt to minify and/or concatenate JavaScript / CSS files, auto-refresh a page upon save, and other nifty tricks that will save you time. And if you're part of a development team, it's a better option than, say, using [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/ "Incident 57 - CodeKit"), simply because you can have the same settings as your colleagues thanks to Grunt's config file (known as a **Gruntfile**).
