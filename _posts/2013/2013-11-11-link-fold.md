title: 'Link: Above the fold'

[http://brolik.com/blog/above-the-fold-vs-below-the-fold-everyone-scrolls/](http://brolik.com/blog/above-the-fold-vs-below-the-fold-everyone-scrolls/) This is a good article that should open up some dialogue with marketers and designers stuck in the print mentality. While the "fold" is still an important concept, and one that is worthy of consideration, we're not developing for a print-centric world anymore. And, with the ubiquity of the web, we can assume our users are familiar with the concept of scrolling. The screen resolution chart on the link is particularly interesting; with all of the devices accessing your site, who's to say exactly where your fold lies? Web and print are different beasts; whereas print is all about real estate and placement, web design should be more focused on usability.
