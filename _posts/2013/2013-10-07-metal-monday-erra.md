Yeehaw! Today's band hails from Birmingham, AL, a few short hours from where I live. I came across these boys a couple of years ago, and their first full-length blew me away. They're the definition of what I like in a heavy band: thick, catchy riffs, solid hooks and melodies, and technical guitars.Â And they're from the South, so bonus points there. Erra's newest CD, entitled "Augment," is coming out the 29th of this month. It's sure to be a banger, and I'd also recommend their previous album, "Impulse." For fans of Misery Signals (my fav), Periphery, or any of that 'djent-y' sound, check **Erra** out below:
