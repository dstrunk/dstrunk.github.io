Good gravy god this band is heavy. The band is a side project of Sky Eats Airplane ex-guitarist Zack Ordway, ex-Periphery drummer Travis Orbin, and Oh, Sleeper guitarist Micha Kinard. All of these guys are absolute pros at their craft; the guitars shred, and the drumming is out of this world. They released two songs in 2011 then fell off the radar. Zack Ordway released an instrumental on his SoundCloud page about six months ago which got me excited, but there's been nothing since. Here's to hoping for a full album in the future! Here's *Area Fifty Done* by **Killtrox and the Motherships**:
