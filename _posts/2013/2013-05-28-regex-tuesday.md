Kind of sad that I'm just now running across this, but it's a great way to build up your regular expression chops! Regular expressions always intimidated me in the past, so my skills in the area are somewhat lacking. I will for sure be supplementing my daily JavaScript studies with RegEx practice in the form of RegEx Tuesday :)
