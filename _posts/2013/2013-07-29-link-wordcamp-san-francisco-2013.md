Mark Jaquith did a great talk at WordCamp San Francisco a couple of days ago. The talk focuses on using version control (**git**, specifically) instead of using SFTP / FTP to make changes to your WordPress install. I myself am guilty of occasionally using SFTP to make changes, so this talk really resonated with me. Mark details a lot of techniques and programs that will help create a more revision-friendly and automated workflow—things like [Capistrano](http://www.capistranorb.com/ "Capistrano"), [WP Stack](https://github.com/markjaquith/WP-Stack/ "WP Stack") (written by Mark) and [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise/ "Puppet"). This talk is highly suggested if you're using WordPress as much as I do!
