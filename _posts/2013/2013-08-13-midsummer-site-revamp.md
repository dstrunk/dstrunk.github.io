A change is as good as a rest... I decided to do a little revamp to the site. Updates include featured post images, breadcrumb navigation, and a general layout design that is both more familiar and makes expanding the site a lot easier. Let me know how you feel about it on Twitter [@dstrunk](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://www.dstrunk.com/midsummer-site-revamp/&via=dstrunk&text=Comment here...&related=dstrunk "Twitter.com | @dstrunk")!
