If only I'd run across this link before thanksgiving, when cornucopias were more relevant. Oh well—it's a fantastic resource anyway! If you consider yourself a developer of any sort and you can't find anything in this list that sparks your interest, you might need to consider changing your career. From Android to Scala, this list has enough compiled knowledge to keep you busy for several lifetimes. Enjoy, and happy Monday!
