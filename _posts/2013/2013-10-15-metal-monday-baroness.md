title: 'Metal Monday: Baroness'
---

Delayed Metal Monday is delayed. We're keeping it southern this week with Baroness. Baroness hails from beautiful Savannah, GA. Though they formed in 2003, they didn't really start making waves 'til 2007 with their Red Album. Their style is in the same vein as High on Fire, Torche, Mastodon and the like. Very gruff vocals, heavy guitars and a droning style. Their melody patterns and hooks are very reminiscent of hymns, which gives them a Southern revival feel in my mind. That coupled with the imagery they use in their lyrics makes them have a very apocalyptic feel. In 2012, they came out with a dual Yellow and Green album (their best in my opinion), which the below video is from.
