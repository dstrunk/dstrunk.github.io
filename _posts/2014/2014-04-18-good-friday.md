title: Good Friday
---

Happy Good Friday! I realize I missed my update last Friday, and with only a partially good reason: I'm swamped! Day work has been particularly taxing these last couple of weeks, but you'll note that I've still found time to work after hours as evidenced by an [ever-growing GitHub contribution streak](//github.com/dstrunk). Sleep is for the uninspired :) Despite a busy work load, time marches on in Rails land. I recently picked up [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4) and began working through it. I'd recommend this book before picking up similar popular books like **The Rails Tutorial**. It not only teaches best practices for Rails development, but also teaches Agile developmentâ€”something that will help manage development in the face of an ever evolving set of use cases and help control client expectations. Because what good is a developer if they can't talk to their client and parse their idea into an application? I'm looking to finish my image to ascii art converter within the next week; after that, refactoring, and perhaps extracting the code into a gem? That's the plan, at least.
