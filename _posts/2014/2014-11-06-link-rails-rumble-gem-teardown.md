This is a great resource for learning what people are using to quickly get their apps ready for their 48 hour hackathons. There's not a lot of suprising information here if you're plugged into the community. 

**But**: if, like me, you happen to be a lone Ruby in the rough, it's nice to see what teams are using for bootstrapping an app, what templating / JavaScript languages devs are gravitating toward, and what CI environments are being used.
