Happy Valentine's Day! Today marks a full month of working with Ruby and / or Ruby on Rails! Crazy how time flies. At moments I feel like I haven't [learned anything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) ... then a question comes along and I find I'm able to explain the concept of [polymorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) to a fellow Rails traveler. Then I feel a bit better :) It feels good to quantify your work. For me that means looking at my [github profile](https://github.com/dstrunk), where I've racked up 30 continuous days of commits. I'm hoping to continue that streak far into the future.* This week I've been focusing more on alternative frameworks and the Ruby language in general. I started development of a blog / portfolio-type deal hosted on Github Pages in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby static site generator. Github Pages handles most (all) of the heavy lifting in Jekyll on their end, but I had to set up a similar environment on my local server for development purposes. I've been plugging away on *The Well-Grounded Rubyist*; not too many in-depth programs so far there, but it's nice to see the inner workings of Ruby that make the "magic" of Rails possible. *There are no previous commits in my history because of a mistake I made in transferring ownership of my account to a new email address. C'est la vie! In a way it was liberating to start fresh again ...
