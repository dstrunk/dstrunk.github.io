I honestly didn't even think about documenting my process on learning Ruby on Rails until this week. Shortsighted, I know. But here it is, my second full week of learning Ruby and Rails (in earnest). I'll try to provide updates every Friday. First, I like to count two weeks ago as my **true** start date for a couple of reasons:

1. There was a little hiccup with my GitHub account; as such, all of my past contribution history was erased. Instead of asking support to look into the issue, I looked at is as a way to clean up my repositories and start fresh.
2. I've attempted both Ruby and Rails in the past, but didn't really pay attention to the tutorials. What resulted was a half-assed Twitter clone that had zero tests, code that was copy-pasted instead of fully understood, and me with a passing, vague knowledge of syntax two weeks later.

So, enough about past attempts, let's look at the last two weeks:

1. **[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com "Railscasts") are awesome.** 'Nuff said.
2. **I purchased [*Rails in Action*](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/ "Rails 4 in Action - Manning") and [*The Well-Grounded Rubyist*](http://www.manning.com/black2/ "The Well-Grounded Rubyist - Manning") from [Manning publications](http://www.manning.com/ "Manning Publications").** I decided to spring for the newest versions available and get in on Manning's Early Access Program (MEAP). So glad I did; in addition to early (unfinished but still solid) editions of the books, I received previous versions of the books in eBook form as well. *The Well-Grounded Rubyist* looks to teach me about some concepts I knew about but didn't really understand, and *Rails 4 in Action *walks through developing a ticket-tracker complete with tests.
3. **[Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development "Test-Driven Development - Wikipedia.org") (TDD) is boring at first, but satisfying.** Previous attempts to learn Rails have seen me eschewing tests, wanting to create as quickly as possible and play with the app in my browser as I developed. This time around, I'm making  a point to learn TDD from the get-go. Not only is it how Rails outfits do business, but it's just plain smart. It's more efficient than opening up a browser and manually testing, it allows for making sure your refactoring doesn't break anything, and it makes your app more trustworthy to other developers / users. Do it.
4. **Stick with it; it's not going to happen overnight.** I don't understand everything I'm doing, but that's not the point right now. The point is to *stop preparing to do* and to *just do. *Don't be afraid of failing and just fail, pick up and do better next time.

Speaking of next time, until then!
