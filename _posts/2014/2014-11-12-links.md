Here are some links that I've found helpful over the last year or so. I'll keep this page updated as I come across other resources.

* [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) - Largely abandoned. Worth a "subscription"â€”because it's unmaintained, I've never been charged more than $9 in the year I've been learning from there. Great for beginners or people looking to understand core concepts better.
* [Go Rails](https://gorails.com/) - Screencasts for learning Ruby on Rails. Meant to take over for Railscasts' absence from the scene.
	* [Setup Ruby on Rails on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.10-yosemite)
    * [Deploy Ruby on Rails on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr](https://gorails.com/deploy/ubuntu/14.04)
* [Upcase by Thoughtbot](https://upcase.com) - Subscription-based learning by the respected Rails development company Thoughtbot. Quality videos, access to the Upcase forums, trail-based learning and access to the very Rails app Upcase runs on.
