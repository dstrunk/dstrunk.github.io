On July 31, 2014 Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, gave a talk at Ninefold in San Francisco. It's a very enlightening talk about the future of Ruby (if that wasn't obvious from the title), as well as Matz's new creation, **mruby**, an embedded lightweight Ruby comparable to the programming language Lua. Check it out: [Video: Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto - The future of Ruby](https://ninefold.com/blog/2014/08/07/ninefold-presents-yukihiro-matz-matsumoto-live/)
