description: Personal website of Daniel Strunk, a web developer
---

I'm Daniel Strunk, a web developer from Columbus, GA, USA. I enjoy working with
and expanding my knowledge of web development through
[Ruby][ruby]{:target="_blank"} and [Elixir][elixir]{:target="_blank"}
(JavaScript can come too--at the moment I'm interested in [Elm][elm]{:target="_blank"}).

I love working with Vim and Tmux, and [my dotfiles][dotfiles]{:target="_blank"}
are a testament to that workflow. I've got a couple of projects I'm hacking on
posted to [my GitHub][github]{:target="_blank"}. Most of the projects are
[breakable toys][apprenticeship-patterns]{:target="_blank"} meant to prove a
concept, but my ultimate goal is to release a couple as SaaS products in the
near future.

[I blog about web development][til]{:target="_blank"} semi-regularly. Got a
topic you'd like to see covered? [Post an issue.][til-issues]{:target="_blank"}

Also, [follow me on Twitter!][twitter]{:target="_blank"} Or, if you have a
burning question or comment that takes up more than 140 characters, you can send
me an email at [hello@danielstrunk.me].
