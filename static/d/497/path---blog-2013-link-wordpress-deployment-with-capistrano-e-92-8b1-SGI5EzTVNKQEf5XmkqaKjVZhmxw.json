{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is an interesting article written by a WordPress developer that decided to use Capistrano for deploying his site. For the uninitiated, Capistrano is primarily used by Ruby or Ruby on Rails developers to manage deployment to various development environments (local, staging and production).
