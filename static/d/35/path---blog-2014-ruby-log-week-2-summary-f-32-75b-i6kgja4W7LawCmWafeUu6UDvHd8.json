{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I honestly didn’t even think about documenting my process on learning Ruby on Rails until this week. Shortsighted, I know. But here it is, my second full week of learning Ruby and Rails (in earnest). I’ll try to provide updates every Friday. First, I like to count two weeks ago as my <strong>true</strong> start date for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There was a little hiccup with my GitHub account; as such, all of my past contribution history was erased. Instead of asking support to look into the issue, I looked at is as a way to clean up my repositories and start fresh.</li>\n<li>I’ve attempted both Ruby and Rails in the past, but didn’t really pay attention to the tutorials. What resulted was a half-assed Twitter clone that had zero tests, code that was copy-pasted instead of fully understood, and me with a passing, vague knowledge of syntax two weeks later.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, enough about past attempts, let’s look at the last two weeks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://railscasts.com\" title=\"Railscasts\">Railscasts</a> are awesome.</strong> ‘Nuff said.</li>\n<li><strong>I purchased <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/bigg2/\" title=\"Rails 4 in Action - Manning\"><em>Rails in Action</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/black2/\" title=\"The Well-Grounded Rubyist - Manning\"><em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em></a> from <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/\" title=\"Manning Publications\">Manning publications</a>.</strong> I decided to spring for the newest versions available and get in on Manning’s Early Access Program (MEAP). So glad I did; in addition to early (unfinished but still solid) editions of the books, I received previous versions of the books in eBook form as well. <em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em> looks to teach me about some concepts I knew about but didn’t really understand, and *Rails 4 in Action *walks through developing a ticket-tracker complete with tests.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\" title=\"Test-Driven Development - Wikipedia.org\">Test-Driven Development</a> (TDD) is boring at first, but satisfying.</strong> Previous attempts to learn Rails have seen me eschewing tests, wanting to create as quickly as possible and play with the app in my browser as I developed. This time around, I’m making  a point to learn TDD from the get-go. Not only is it how Rails outfits do business, but it’s just plain smart. It’s more efficient than opening up a browser and manually testing, it allows for making sure your refactoring doesn’t break anything, and it makes your app more trustworthy to other developers / users. Do it.</li>\n<li><strong>Stick with it; it’s not going to happen overnight.</strong> I don’t understand everything I’m doing, but that’s not the point right now. The point is to <em>stop preparing to do</em> and to *just do. *Don’t be afraid of failing and just fail, pick up and do better next time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Speaking of next time, until then!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby log: week 2 summary","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ruby-log-week-2-summary","blogpath":"blog/2014/ruby-log-week-2-summary","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2014-01-31"}}
