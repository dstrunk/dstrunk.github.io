GatsbyJS seemed like a great lower-barrier entry into both React and PWAs, with its fantastic documentation, strong community and abundant tutorials.</p>\n<p>[gatsby][//]</p>\n<p>To learn Gatsby, I decided to revamp my blog. It’s a prime candidate for this type of project: it’s already built on GitHub Pages using Jekyll, which means all pages are flat files. Gatsby also has a plugin for deploying to GitHub Pages, which means I can continue hosting there and not worry about finding a new host and updating DNS.</p>\n<h2>Next week</h2>\n<h3>Advanced React with Wes Bos</h3>\n<p>Learning React and GraphQL in more depth has been on my radar for some time. I purchased Wes Bos’s Advanced React as soon as it was released, but have not fully completed it. In Advanced React, Wes uses the popular GraphQL client Apollo alongside Gatsby to create a fully-functional PWA storefront. It’s pretty clear that Magento is going all-in on GraphQL and React (which I consider a good thing for the most part), so I think it’s in my best interest to stay ahead of the curve by really grokking the concepts introduced in Wes’s Advanced React course.</p>\n<p>[advanced-react][//]\n[apollo][//]</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GatsbyJS and GitHub Pages","date":"2019-25-01T11:01:00Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/01-25-gatsby-js-github-pages/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World!"}}}}
