{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Today I was working on a new Magento 1.x install. A new install workflow usually goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download a zip of the newest Magento 1.x release</li>\n<li>Extract the contents into the folder of choice</li>\n<li>Update <code class=\"language-text\">app/etc/local.xml</code> to point to the correct database</li>\n<li>Add a new virtual host in my vagrant box pointing to the Magento 1.x folder of choice</li>\n<li>Install as necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That usually works fine, but today I was running into some issues. Everything looked fine, but the virtual host was throwing up 403 forbidden errors, leading me to think that there was some sort of permissions issue. Following the reference guides, I ran the following to make sure:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">find</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">.</span> -type f <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">xargs</span> <span class=\"token function\">chmod</span> 400\n<span class=\"token function\">find</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">.</span> -type d <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">xargs</span> <span class=\"token function\">chmod</span> 500\n<span class=\"token function\">find</span> var/ media/ -type f <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">xargs</span> <span class=\"token function\">chmod</span> 600\n<span class=\"token function\">find</span> var/ media/ -type d <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">xargs</span> <span class=\"token function\">chmod</span> 700\n<span class=\"token function\">chmod</span> 700 includes\n<span class=\"token function\">chmod</span> 600 includes/config.php</code></pre></div>\n<p>After that, reloaded the page, and … nothing. I then ran <code class=\"language-text\">ls -la</code> inside the folder of the Magento install to make sure the <code class=\"language-text\">chmod</code> changes occurred, and noticed:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">---snip---\n-rw-r--r--@   1 dstrunk  staff    2329 Oct 27  2015 index.php.sample\n---snip---</code></pre></div>\n<p>What’s that <code class=\"language-text\">@</code> symbol? I’d never seen that before. Looking it up, I found that the <code class=\"language-text\">@</code> symbol represents a file or directory that has extended attributes. If you run the command <code class=\"language-text\">xargs -l &lt;filename&gt;</code>, you will see these attributes in the form of a reverse domain name; something like <code class=\"language-text\">com.apple.attribute</code>.</p>\n<p>In my case, all files in my unzipped directory contained the attribute <code class=\"language-text\">com.apple.quarantine</code>. This is a feature that flags the content as having come from a potentially untrustworthy source. That’s all well and good, but how do we remove this attribute? Pretty simple, it turns out. Simply run the following within the folder you’re looking to unquarantine:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <span class=\"token keyword\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>All that said, my issue ended up being an improperly configured Vagrant configuration… but that was a good learning experience :).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Removing com.apple.quarantine","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"removing-com-apple-quarantine","blogpath":"blog/2016/removing-com-apple-quarantine","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2016-06-23"}}
