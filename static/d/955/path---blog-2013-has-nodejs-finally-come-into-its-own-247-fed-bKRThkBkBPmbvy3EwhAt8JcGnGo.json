{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If you couldn’t tell by the two posts in one day, I’m pretty excited about <a href=\"http://tryghost.org/\" title=\"Ghost\">Ghost</a>. My previous post detailed Ghost’s feature set, but this post is more in regards to the back-end tech powering the spooky blog software. As much of a node fanboy I am, I have been reluctant to go “all in” with developing on the platform. While I’m <em>relatively</em> new to the development side of things, I’ve been creating websites since my parents first got a 56k modem. I remember the introduction of CGI (and the cgi-bin), PHP, ASP, etc. And I watched as PHP became a household name. PHP’s proliferation was twofold: the ease of the language made it simple to inject into an HTML site, but also the fact that WordPress, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/wordpress-now-powers-22-percent-of-new-active-websites-in-the-us/\" title=\"Tech Crunch: WordPress Now Powers 22% of New Active Websites in the US\">which powered <strong>14.7% of all websites in the world in 2011</strong></a>, was written in PHP did much to make the language a mainstay.  Because of this market saturation, support for PHP is fantastic. Of course you can install it on a VPS or personal server, but you’ll also find it available on shared hosting solutions à la Dreamhost and the like. This kind of support pretty much guarantees PHP won’t be going anywhere for the foreseeable future. I got a bit off-topic there, but I promise you there’s a point. I look at PHP’s market saturation, and can’t help but see the two factors that led to its dominance reflected in nodeJS:</p>\n<p>1.An ease of injecting the language into client-side sites (it’s JavaScript! We already know how to write this!).</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A solid bit of blog / CMS software that will allow for easy setup of new sites powered by Node.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> I’m hoping that Ghost will do for Node what WordPress did for PHP. Judging by the Kickstarter numbers, it looks like there’s a few people that feel similarly; Ghost reached its goal just 24 hours after being posted up. And I believe that Ghost’s promise to provide a hosting solution for its more technically illiterate users is a solid step in getting its name out to the masses.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Has NodeJS finally come into its own?","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"has-nodejs-finally-come-into-its-own","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2013-04-29"}}
