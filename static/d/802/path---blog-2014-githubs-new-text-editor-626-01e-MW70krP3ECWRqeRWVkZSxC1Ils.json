{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Details are scant at this point in time, but it looks like <a href=\"http://github.com/\">Github’s</a> looking to release a text editor very soon. I was tipped off by a tweet by Addy Osmani earlier this morning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Exciting! It looks like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/github\">@github</a> may be working on a new code editor called Atom: <a href=\"https://t.co/6E35BS2MXu\">https://t.co/6E35BS2MXu</a> Preview: <a href=\"http://t.co/rseFQlfVc9\">pic.twitter.com/rseFQlfVc9</a>— Addy Osmani (@addyosmani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/addyosmani/statuses/438637505500282881\">February 26, 2014</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script> Github doesn't seem terribly concerned about keeping the text editor under lock-and-key; the organization [Atom](https://github.com/atom) has been made public with full view of all of the \"secret\" text editor's repositories. Oh right—by the way, the text editor's code name / real name is Atom. [Here's the website](https://atom.io), though it hasn't been turned on yet. There's also a Twitter account, [@AtomEditor](https://twitter.com/AtomEditor), which, despite their exactly 0 tweets as of this article, has already garnered over 880 followers. After doing a bit of digging, it looks like the editor will be web-based (similar to Adobe's [brackets](http://brackets.io/)?), and looks to work similarly to Sublime. Personally, I'm looking forward to some sort of deep Github integration (why else release a text editor in a saturated market?). I'll leave you with a gif of the editor in action (from their repository): [![85e69ff2-6a93-11e3-89ac-31927f604592](http://res.cloudinary.com/dstrunk/image/upload/v1414083569/85e69ff2-6a93-11e3-89ac-31927f604592_azzv1v.gif)](http://res.cloudinary.com/dstrunk/image/upload/v1414083569/85e69ff2-6a93-11e3-89ac-31927f604592_azzv1v.gif)","frontmatter":{"title":"Github's new text editor","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"githubs-new-text-editor","blogpath":"blog/2014/githubs-new-text-editor","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2014-02-26"}}
