Presenter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@tjschuck\">T.J. Schuck</a>, a developer at <a href=\"http://getharvest.com\">Harvest</a>, goes over some poor choices/hopefully not-so-common mistakes developers make when handling authentication / passwords in general. <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> The long and short takeaway is <a href=\"http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/\">use bcrypt</a>. I love this quote by Schuck:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By virtue of the fact that I <em>have</em> users, I <strong>have to be</strong> [a security] expert. Ignorance is not an excuse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The presentation explains how authentication used to be handled (Plain text, hashed, hashed + salted, and finally bcrypt), and why bcrypt is a great choice for long-term maintained password protection.</p>\n<p>I haven’t watched the rest of the videos from Rocky Mountain Ruby Conf, but I’d suggest going through the library and picking out some other topics that interest you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Link: 80,000 Plaintext Passwords: An Open Source Love Story in Three Acts","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"link-80-000-plaintext-passwords-an-open-source-love-story-in-three-acts","blogpath":"blog/2014/link-80-000-plaintext-passwords-an-open-source-love-story-in-three-acts","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2014-11-03"}}
