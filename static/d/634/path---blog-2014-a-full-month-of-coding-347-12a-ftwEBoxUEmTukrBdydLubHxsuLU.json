{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Happy Valentine’s Day! Today marks a full month of working with Ruby and / or Ruby on Rails! Crazy how time flies. At moments I feel like I haven’t <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">learned anything</a> … then a question comes along and I find I’m able to explain the concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)\">polymorphism</a> to a fellow Rails traveler. Then I feel a bit better :) It feels good to quantify your work. For me that means looking at my <a href=\"https://github.com/dstrunk\">github profile</a>, where I’ve racked up 30 continuous days of commits. I’m hoping to continue that streak far into the future.* This week I’ve been focusing more on alternative frameworks and the Ruby language in general. I started development of a blog / portfolio-type deal hosted on Github Pages in <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby static site generator. Github Pages handles most (all) of the heavy lifting in Jekyll on their end, but I had to set up a similar environment on my local server for development purposes. I’ve been plugging away on <em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em>; not too many in-depth programs so far there, but it’s nice to see the inner workings of Ruby that make the “magic” of Rails possible. *There are no previous commits in my history because of a mistake I made in transferring ownership of my account to a new email address. C’est la vie! In a way it was liberating to start fresh again …</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A full month of coding","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-full-month-of-coding","type":"blog"}}
