{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As a newer Rails developer, I can wrap my head around smaller, less complex projects. But as a project grows in complexity, I get more and more reluctant to even begin to attempt to understand it—backing away slowly, then finally turning and running for dear life. Recently, however, I came across <a href=\"http://railroady.prestonlee.com/\">RailRoady</a>, a gem billed as “dirt simple UML generation for Rails 3 and 4 applications.” For the uninitiated, UML stands for “Unified Modeling Language,” a specification that models application structure, behavior and architecture. As a visual person, I’ve found that generating UML diagrams is helpful in understanding more sophisticated Rails apps. Using Railroady is easy. First, include railroady as a development dependency in Rails:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ruby\"><pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code class=\"language-ruby\">group <span class=\"token symbol\">:development</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token symbol\">:test</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span>\n  gem <span class=\"token string\">'railroady'</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">end</span></code></pre></div>\n<p> After a quick <code class=\"language-text\">bundle install</code>, run railroady’s rake task: <code class=\"language-text\">rake diagram:all</code>. This will generate four svg files under doc/*.svg.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Studying existing Rails projects with Railroady","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"studying-existing-rails-projects-with-railroady","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2014-06-26"}}
