{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Over the weekend I completed version 0.6 of my gem, <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/roboparts\">roboparts</a>. Roboparts is a command line tool that piggybacks on the Rails engine to create custom defaults that I use a lot when setting up new projects. To use, run <code class=\"language-text\">roboparts your-project</code> to build a customized rails framework with RSpec, FactoryGirl, and some other goodies already set up for you.</p>\n<p>When setting up new Rails projects over the last couple of months, I realized I was spending a lot of time setting up a lot of boilerplate: installing gems,  generating the same scaffolds, adding test dependencies, and adding CSS or shared application layouts. Taking a page from one of my favorite development agencies, Thoughtbot, I decided to create a similar gem to their <a href=\"https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders\">suspenders</a>.</p>\n<p>This was a huge learning experience for me. Writing a gem is something I’d always wanted to do, but found too daunting. I referenced the HELL out of suspenders, but am refining the gem as I learn more about the process.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested, check out <a href=\"http://github.com/silentpost/roboparts\">the source</a> for an idea of everything involved.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Roboparts: configuring the Rails framework","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"roboparts-configuring-the-rails-framework","blogpath":"blog/2015/roboparts-configuring-the-rails-framework","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2015-01-24"}}
