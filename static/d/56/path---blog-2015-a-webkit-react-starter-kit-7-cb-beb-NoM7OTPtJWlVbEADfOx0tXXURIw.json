{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Over the last couple of days, I’ve been prototyping a web application that I’ve\nhad an idea for ever since jumping into Rails. It was on the backburner for a\nwhile until I could figure out how to handle such a dynamic UI… Then\n<a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a> came out. React is providing exactly the functionality I’m\nlooking for—able to use components in a web application without hijacking the\nentire view (a la Ember), and with a cleaner separation of concerns (looking at\nAngular here).</p>\n<p>It’s been a while since I’ve dabbled in the front end, though—and the landscape\nhas changed. <a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a>, <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>, widespread adoption of ES6… I\nwas a bit overwhelmed for a couple of hours catching up. Because of this, I put\ntogether a webpack starter kit to easily pull down when prototyping new React\nprojects:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dstrunk/webpack-react-starter-kit\">https://github.com/dstrunk/webpack-react-starter-kit</a></p>\n<p>To get started with this project, clone it or download the zip from GitHub.\nYou’ll need a couple of things from NPM, so run the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g webpack\nnpm install -g webpack-dev-server</code></pre></div>\n<p>After installing webpack and webpack-dev-server globally, run the following to\ninstall package dependencies:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm install</code></pre></div>\n<p>From there, you can simply run <code class=\"language-text\">npm run start</code>. This command (seen in our\n<code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> file)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>starts an <code class=\"language-text\">http-server</code> running our local directory on port <code class=\"language-text\">8080</code></li>\n<li>starts <code class=\"language-text\">webpack-dev-server</code> on port <code class=\"language-text\">8090</code> which serves the\n<code class=\"language-text\">webpack-dev-server</code> runtime and our <code class=\"language-text\">app.js</code> file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>… and that’s it! Once setup, you’ll have an environment that allows you to get\nstarted quickly with prototyping React applications, and keeps productivity high\nby watching files and refreshing when necessary.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A webkit React starter kit","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-webkit-react-starter-kit","type":"blog"}}
