In the meantime, here is a great primer on setting up <a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\" title=\"Grunt JS\">Grunt</a> to simplify your workflow. You can use Grunt to minify and/or concatenate JavaScript / CSS files, auto-refresh a page upon save, and other nifty tricks that will save you time. And if you’re part of a development team, it’s a better option than, say, using <a href=\"https://incident57.com/codekit/\" title=\"Incident 57 - CodeKit\">CodeKit</a>, simply because you can have the same settings as your colleagues thanks to Grunt’s config file (known as a <strong>Gruntfile</strong>).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Link: Simplifying chores with Grunt","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"link-simplifying-chores-with-grunt","blogpath":"blog/2013/link-simplifying-chores-with-grunt","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2013-08-12"}}
