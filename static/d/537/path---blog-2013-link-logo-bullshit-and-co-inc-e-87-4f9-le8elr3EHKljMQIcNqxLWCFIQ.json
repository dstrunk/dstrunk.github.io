What a fantastic article deriding the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/yahoo-unveils-logo-043439762.html\" title=\"Yahoo! News - Yahoo Unveils a New Logo\">new Yahoo logo</a>. For the uninitiated, Yahoo’s CEO Marissa Mayer wrote a blog post detailing how the new logo came to fruition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team: Bob Stohrer, Marc DeBartolomeis, Russ Khaydarov, and our intern Max Ma. We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Pretty insulting from a design standpoint, and shows exactly the kind of vision Mayer has as a CEO. This iA article hits every coffin nail in this terrible Yahoo logo business. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to mindlessly moving pixels around. Happy Friday :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Link: Logo, Bullshit and Co., Inc.","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"link-logo-bullshit-and-co-inc","type":"blog"}}
