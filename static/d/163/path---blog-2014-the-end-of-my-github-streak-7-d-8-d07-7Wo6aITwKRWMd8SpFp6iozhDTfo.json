When I started this Rails journey, I made a personal commitment to tackle a full 365 days of developing, using GitHub’s contribution graph to track my progress. Well, while I did work on some projects last night, I either forgot to push my progress or didn’t merge a branch.

My OCD almost can’t handle it. I’ll get over it, though. This is just the thing needed to rededicate myself to Rails, I suppose—if I’m being completely honest, after the first two months I was pretty much bouncing around on projects and treading water. And it’s by no means the end—just another opportunity to start over.
