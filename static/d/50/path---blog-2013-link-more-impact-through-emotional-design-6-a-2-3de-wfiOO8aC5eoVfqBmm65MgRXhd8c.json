Today’s link is a little different from previous ones, seeing as it’s geared more towards design than development. It’s an interesting piece nonetheless, and certainly falls within the wheelhouse of front-end developers, though: emotional design, and its impact on web design. Emotional design summarized basically refers to the fact that things that are aesthetically pleasing appear to be more effective because of their appeal. This is due to an emotional attachment formed by the user. This concept plays heavily (either consciously or subconsciously) into product development, brand attachment and more. Enough rambling; though I find the psychology fascinating,  this was supposed to be a link, not a post :) Enjoy!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Link: More Impact Through Emotional Design","date":"2013-08-23T16:50:14.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"link-more-impact-through-emotional-design","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2013-08-23"}}
