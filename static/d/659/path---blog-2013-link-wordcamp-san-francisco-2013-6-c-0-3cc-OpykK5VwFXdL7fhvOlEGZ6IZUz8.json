The talk focuses on using version control (<strong>git</strong>, specifically) instead of using SFTP / FTP to make changes to your WordPress install. I myself am guilty of occasionally using SFTP to make changes, so this talk really resonated with me. Mark details a lot of techniques and programs that will help create a more revision-friendly and automated workflow—things like <a href=\"http://www.capistranorb.com/\" title=\"Capistrano\">Capistrano</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/markjaquith/WP-Stack/\" title=\"WP Stack\">WP Stack</a> (written by Mark) and <a href=\"http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise/\" title=\"Puppet\">Puppet</a>. This talk is highly suggested if you’re using WordPress as much as I do!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Link: WordCamp San Francisco 2013","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"link-wordcamp-san-francisco-2013","blogpath":"blog/2013/link-wordcamp-san-francisco-2013","type":"blog","jekyllDate":"2013-07-29"}}
