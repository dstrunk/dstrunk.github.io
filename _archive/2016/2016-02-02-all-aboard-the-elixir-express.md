description: A good conference talk on Elixir, featuring @chris_mccord

I'm taking a two-pronged approach to learning Elixir and Phoenix. The first is
educational: I've got books on both subjects from [The Pragmatic
Bookshelf][pragprog], and most recently, have been watching
conference talks. Specifically, this one here presented by Chris McCord, creator
of the Phoenix framework:

[RailsConf 2014 - Workshop - All Aboard the Elixir Express! by Chris
McCord][elixir-express]

On the other end of the spectrum, the practical: I'm working through all the
tutorials I can. This approach lent itself well to Ruby--a combination of
well-authored books and the Rails tutorial got me comfortable enough to figure
out how to stumble forward to the right answer. Which is 95% of what programming
is.
