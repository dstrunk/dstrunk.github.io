I updated my site for 2013! In addition to a general site redesign, I've reorganized the site, featuring the portfolio more prominently. Other site features:

- Responsive grid based on percentages
- More robust admin features (custom Portfolio and Form post types)
- A handful of easter eggs which will remain nameless (you'll just have to dig for yourself!)
