[This post by Si digital](http://sidigital.co/blog/disconnect-your-frontend-from-wordpress) recently detailed their company's process for using WordPress in a pretty cool way. See, they wanted to continue using WordPress's admin backend, because it's user-friendly, people are familiar with it, and existing systems might depend on it. But they found that WordPress's frontend left something to be desired—they frequently needed more information than [The Loop](codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) could provide, and in a more succinct manner. I went ahead and went a bit further with Si digital's idea—incorporating PHP's [Slim framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) into Si Digital's class, allowing for custom routing completely independent of WordPress's permalink structure. I'm calling the marriage of these two ideas (all tongue-in-cheek punnery intended) **WP Loupe.**[![loupe](http://res.cloudinary.com/dstrunk/image/upload/v1414083562/loupe_jncexu.png)](https://github.com/dstrunk/loupe) WP Loupe is an extremely simple bit of code that hijacks the WordPress initialization with its own similar init, instantiating a class that can be used to call any function outside of traditional WordPress functions. The folder structure is similar to a more opinionated framework (*ahem* Rails *cough*), for ease of maintenance. I've got some ideas moving forward, including incorporating a more robust controller and including a PHP templating framework. If you enjoy the WordPress admin structure, but find using the loop a bit painful for some of your more nontraditional WordPress projects, check out WP Loupe: [WP Loupe](https://github.com/dstrunk/loupe)
