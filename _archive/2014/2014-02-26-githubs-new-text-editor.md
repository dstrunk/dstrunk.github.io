Details are scant at this point in time, but it looks like [Github's](http://github.com/) looking to release a text editor very soon. I was tipped off by a tweet by Addy Osmani earlier this morning:

> Exciting! It looks like [@github](https://twitter.com/github) may be working on a new code editor called Atom: [https://t.co/6E35BS2MXu](https://t.co/6E35BS2MXu) Preview: [pic.twitter.com/rseFQlfVc9](http://t.co/rseFQlfVc9)— Addy Osmani (@addyosmani) [February 26, 2014](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/statuses/438637505500282881)

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> Github doesn't seem terribly concerned about keeping the text editor under lock-and-key; the organization [Atom](https://github.com/atom) has been made public with full view of all of the "secret" text editor's repositories. Oh right—by the way, the text editor's code name / real name is Atom. [Here's the website](https://atom.io), though it hasn't been turned on yet. There's also a Twitter account, [@AtomEditor](https://twitter.com/AtomEditor), which, despite their exactly 0 tweets as of this article, has already garnered over 880 followers. After doing a bit of digging, it looks like the editor will be web-based (similar to Adobe's [brackets](http://brackets.io/)?), and looks to work similarly to Sublime. Personally, I'm looking forward to some sort of deep Github integration (why else release a text editor in a saturated market?). I'll leave you with a gif of the editor in action (from their repository): [![85e69ff2-6a93-11e3-89ac-31927f604592](http://res.cloudinary.com/dstrunk/image/upload/v1414083569/85e69ff2-6a93-11e3-89ac-31927f604592_azzv1v.gif)](http://res.cloudinary.com/dstrunk/image/upload/v1414083569/85e69ff2-6a93-11e3-89ac-31927f604592_azzv1v.gif)
